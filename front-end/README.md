## Overview
[Check it out here!](https://restaurant-reservation-frontend-bste.onrender.com)

The Restaurant Reservation System is an application that allows restaurant owners to manage reservations and tables. It offers both front-end and back-end functionalities, including table assignments, reservation listings, and more. Developed using a PERN stack, it serves as a robust example of a full-stack project.

## Skills and Techniques Demonstrated

### Back-End Development
- **Database Design:** Utilized PostgreSQL and Knex.js for schema migration, table creation and database normalization.
- **RESTful API:** Created an API using Node.js and Express to perform CRUD operations.
- **Error Handling:** Implemented error-handling middleware for a smoother user experience.
- **Middleware:** Utilized custom Express middleware for validation and resource existence checks.
- **Data Validation:** Checked data constraints such as `notNullable()` and data types in the database schema.

### Front-End Development
- **UI Design:** Developed a responsive, user-friendly interface using React.
- **State Management:** Utilized React Hooks and `useState` for efficient state management.
- **AJAX:** Used Axios for API calls to the back-end.
- **Routing:** Implemented client-side routing using React Router.
- **Form Handling:** Built robust forms with real-time validation.
- **CSS Styling:** Utilized custom CSS for layout and design.

### Testing and Debugging
- **Unit Testing:** Leveraged Jest for back-end testing.
- **End-to-End Testing:** Used Cypress for front-end testing.
- **Abort Controller:** Used AbortController to manage API request cancellation.

### DevOps
- **Version Control:** Managed codebase using Git.
- **Deployment:** Utilized Render for project deployment.
- **Fetch API:** Used native Fetch API for server communications.
